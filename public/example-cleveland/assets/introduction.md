# Introduction

Thank you for participating in our study today. We are students who are currently taking CS4804, data visualization, with Professor Lane Harrison. As an assignment, we are replicating a famous study on graphical perception by Cleveland & McGill in 1984. 

The goal of the study is to learn how people interpret different types of charts. You will be shown a series of charts and asked questions about them.

The study is only for academic use and will not be officially published. Don't overthink your answers. We are looking for natural, instinctive answers. Thank you for your participating!
